* Introduction
This is an Emacs minor mode for [[https://github.com/hyperfiddle/electric][Electric Clojure]]. It colors client and server sites in source code.

Here's a simple example:

* Installation
To install, copy the file ~nomis-electric-clojure.el~ to a place where it will
be found by your Emacs and add the following to your init file:
#+begin_src elisp
  (require 'nomis-electric-clojure)
#+end_src
* Turning on nomis-electric-clojure-mode
To turn on nomis-electric-clojure-mode, run ~M-x nomis-electric-clojure-mode~.
* Overview of Features
nomis-electric-clojure-mode does the following:

- Auto-detects whether the code is Electric v2 or Electric v3. It does this by
  looking for ~[hyperfiddle.electric :as e]~ or ~[hyperfiddle.electric3 :as e]~
  at the start of the file. If it can't decide, it assumes v3.

- Applies separate colors to client regions and server regions.

- Does not apply a color to regions that may be either client or server.

nomis-electric-clojure-mode does not look at the call tree, so regions of code
that are not colored may in fact always run on one site.
